Welcome to CerebStats documentation!
==================================================

CerebStats is one of the four components for validating cerebellum models: two being `CerebModels <https://github.com/cerebunit/cerebmodels>`_ and `CerebData <https://github.com/cerebunit/cerebdata>`_, which does not require installation while `CerebUnit <https://github.com/cerebunit/cerebunit>`_ and CerebStats require installation.

This is the documentation for the **CerebStats** component.
